# Responsive Map Demo â€“ Work in Progress

## Implementation Notes
- Built using D3 and topojson
- Dorling cartogram based on [Harry Stevens' Dorling cartogram on Observable](https://observablehq.com/@harrystevens/dorling-cartogram)
- [Circle legend](https://observablehq.com/@harrystevens/circle-legend) is also by Harry Stevens

## Data Sources
- Boundaries and population data from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/) via [Harry Stevens' Dorling cartogram on Observable](https://observablehq.com/@harrystevens/dorling-cartogram)
- [List of countries by continents](https://statisticstimes.com/geography/countries-by-continents.php)
- The data has been modified slightly to fix missing ISO codes and match each country or region in the Natural Earth dataset to a continent.
