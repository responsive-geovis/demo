# Responsive Map Demo â€“ Work in Progress

-   Built using D3 and topojson

## Example #1: World Population Map

-   Dorling cartogram based on [Harry Stevens' Dorling cartogram on Observable](https://observablehq.com/@harrystevens/dorling-cartogram)
-   [Circle legend](https://observablehq.com/@harrystevens/circle-legend) is also by Harry Stevens

### Data

-   Boundaries and population data from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/) via [Harry Stevens' Dorling cartogram on Observable](https://observablehq.com/@harrystevens/dorling-cartogram)
-   [List of countries by continents](https://statisticstimes.com/geography/countries-by-continents.php)
-   The data has been modified slightly to fix missing ISO codes and match each country or region in the Natural Earth dataset to a continent.

-   Color scheme taken from BBC maps

### Data

-   UK map by parliamentary constituency via [Martin Chorley's Github repo](https://github.com/martinjc/UK-GeoJSON/), combined using QGIS and simplified and converted to topojson using mapshaper.org.
-   Hex map of UK parliamentary constituencies via [ODI Leeds](https://odileeds.github.io/hexmaps/constituencies/)
